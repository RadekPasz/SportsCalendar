First, I used chatGPT to create a structured plan of the project for me. While I didn't follow it step-by-step, it gave me a good overview of how to roughly structure the project and served as a solid foundation. It also helped me with bug fixing. During the implementation, I ran into an error where the event submission form did not actually add new events to the calendar. I did not have much experience working with web development in the past, so I asked chatGPT for help with troubleshooting. It gave me a solution to use chrome DevTools and helped me identify the error. With its help, I was able to quickly and efficiently solve the bug, as the fix itself was easy, it was just something I overlooked. It also helped me solve a bug where the dropdown menu did not fill with possible sports and venues. It offered me a quick and efficient solution which worked instantly. One other AI usage for this project was for the filtering mechanism. I had not done anything like it in the past, so I struggled a bit with the implementation. AI gave me an effective SQL prompt to retrieve events by keywords, which solved my issue. I of course made sure to learn how it works, in case I need to implement a similar mechanism in the future. In my opinion, AI's biggest advantage is being able to present solutions in a fast and easy to understand way, and that is how I try to use it in my project. However, I always double check any information that it gives me, as I know from past experiences that it's not always reliable.
